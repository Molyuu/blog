This is probably my third blog site.

## My First Experience
Let's go back to June 2021, when I was still in Grade 7 and just starting with GNU/Linux. I set up my first blog website using Hexo and GitHub Pages. I wrote a short Arch Linux installation guide, like many other newbies (though I never finished it, LMAO). I was amazed by the customization options and fancy themes, powered by a strong and active community. However, as someone who wants to express themselves immediately, the drawbacks were clear: **When inspiration hit, I wanted to write and express myself right away, but sometimes I couldn't because I was on the go.**

And unfortunately it's gone after an accident happened with my computer, I was too noob to fix it at that time so I just drop it right away.

## xLog: Good, but Not Really
I considered using xLog. It looks good and is easy to get started with, can be used at any time and on any device, and is even blockchain-powered, making it more secure. However, I am still not used to the blockchain, and no matter what you do, the MetaFox plugin seems to be a spammer, always asking for permissions I have already granted. This annoying issue made me give up on xLog.

## So what about the current one? And what's it for?
As you guys can discover, the current one is still powered by Hexo, but it's now hosted on Vercel and full configuration is available on GitHub, makes it easier.

I'm too sleepy to write the rest of these.
